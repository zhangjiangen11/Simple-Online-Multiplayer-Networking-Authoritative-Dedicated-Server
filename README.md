### Simple Online Multiplayer Networking Authoritative Dedicated Server



A simple Godot multiplayer setup. Change the IP address to your cloud service and compile and upload it as a Linux headless version. The clients will connect automatically to the server. The server has full authority; the player can only send inputs to prevent cheating. The server is the only one able to see the player's inputs. The server picks a random map. The server will spawn the clients and search for the nodes in the spawn area group, choose one randomly, get its dimension and set a random position inside the area.

In the console go in your server folder where you have saved your dms file (NEVER save it in your server folder to avoid uploading it by mistake):



cd "C:\\Users\\YOUR\_NAME\\Desktop\\security"



Then type:



ssh -i mykey.pem ec2-user@YOUR\_DNS\_HERE
